# whc-tdd-meetup

This is my code that I did during the TDD meetup.  [https://www.facebook.com/womenwhocodekl]

I choose to do the code in node.js and use Mocha [http://mochajs.org/] as the test framework and Chai [http://chaijs.com/] as the assertion library.

Since I've put the test command into the scripts section of the package.json the tests can run with ```npm test```, or they can be started with just typing mocha on the command line.

This repository can be downloaded by using the "Download ZIP" button you'll find on the right hand side of this page.
